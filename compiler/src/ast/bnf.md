# The syntax definition

This file gives the defnition of the syntax, along with some elaboration on the sorts of ambiguitiy
that can occur in parsing (and how those are resolved / delayed).

### Givens

Before giving the definitions of each syntax element, we'll lay out a few of the pieces that are
taken as given by the tokenizer.

#### Comments

There are two types of comments parsed by the tokenizer - block and line comments. These are defined
such that line comments start with `//` and may occur anywhere on a line (outside of a string
literal), and block comments are delimeted by `/*` and `*/`. Block comments may themselves contain
block comments, which is handled by the tokenizer. The specifics of how this works won't be
described here.

#### Other items

Comments aside, the tokenizer produce only a few different "compound" tokens (those composed of
multiple characters) - whitespace, identifiers, and strings, character, and integer literals.

Roughly, each of these (aside from whitespace) are given by:

```
Ident          = { "_" | "a" .. "z" | "A" .. "Z" } .
StringLiteral = <"> { char } <">
CharLiteral   = "'" char '"'
IntLiteral    = { digit } .
```

Note that string and character literals currently *do not* support escaped characters. This will be
added in the future. Additionally, while integer literals are *syntactically* allowed leading
zeroes, this is semantically disallowed. The same can be said for indentifiers containing only
underscores.

### Definition

What follows is essentially the full BNF definition for the syntax. This is not written in a style
suitable for immediately translating to a recursive-descent parser, and instead written to emphasize
readability.

A single file is composed of `item`s, which essentially make up the top-level definitions and
declarations.
