/// A singleton, unique type that only exists to act as an object for cross-macro storage
///
/// Through traits and associated items, we can create the effect of communication and storage
/// across macros. The typical problem we'll solve is something like: "How does a proc-macro in
/// module 'foo' know about the input to the macro in module 'bar'?"
///
/// We're able to solve this by requring that the macro in 'foo' be able to reproduce some trait
/// defined in 'bar'. Let's walk through an example.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// Say we're in the middle of some proc-macro (like `hydra_macros::__make_database`, for example),
/// and we want to be able to use a set of types and constants defined by a separate, attribute
/// macro.
///
/// - this is useful because it allows us to avoid using `Box<dyn Any>` inside of the
/// database.
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[proc_macro]
/// fn __make_database(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
///     // -- snip --
///     
///     // We're going to suppose that all we're given about the other invocation is the name of
///     // some trait we generated.
///     let trait_name = /* generated; maybe __DummyFoo from trait Foo */
///
///     // Typically, there's many uses of `Dummy`, so we abbreviate:
///     let dummy = quote!(hydra::internal::Dummy as #trait_name);
///     
///     // With `Dummy` here, we're able to extract types, constants, and functions defined by the
///     // other proc-macro. Here's a type:
///     let bar_type = quote!(<#dummy>::Bar);
///
///     // And here's a constant:
///     let baz_const = quote!(<#dummy>::Baz);
///     // Oh wait! They look exactly the same! We just have to be careful not to confuse our types
///     // with our constants.
///
///     // Now we can do fun things with this, like emit code *here* based on the input somewhere
///     // else:
///     quote!(
///         struct MyStruct {
///             bar: #bar_type,
///         }
///
///         impl MyStruct {
///             fn baz() -> u32 {
///                 #baz_const
///             }
///         }
///     )
/// }
